1.4.0

New
---

* HOLY CRAP!  I never provided a topic change event?!?  Well, now it's here.  :incoming_topic_change
  at your service.  Note that this is VERY DIFFERENT from the numeric :incoming_topic event, which
  only tells you current topic for a channel.
  * NOTE: if you've been handling topic changes via the miscellaneous handler, you *will* have to
    change your code!
* prepend_handler can now take a block instead of just a Proc object!
* In addition to using the `start_listening` method of Net::YAIL, you can now call the "dangerous"
  version of that method: `start_listening!`, which wraps the "safe" version, but also starts an
  endless loop.  For extremely simple bots, this is simplifies your codebase greatly.
* New bot example added to demonstrate a very simple case that's still pretty easy to extend and
  configure: examples/simple/dumbbot.rb

Changes
-------

* CTRL+C termination now results in a graceful termination which includes sending QUIT to the server
* Major event handling overhaul.  Legacy apps *should* work fine, but if not, please let me know
  by filing a ticket on github or something!
  * For those who care, the back-end is now using a new class for handling and storing events.
    This class is eventually going to be used for all handlers, rather than passing around a bunch
    of arguments that are often unused.
* README was removed in favor of two files: YAIL-RDOC for the rdoc "intro" info, and README.md for
  a github-friendly description of the bot.

Fixes
-----

* Nickname change in forced handler is now safer
* Version information is now stored outside the main YAIL library
* TODO updated a lot to better reflect my short-, medium-, and long-term goals
* General update to documentation - a few grammatical fixes, some doc errors fixed, etc
* MessageParser fixes to make it better at handling some of the edge cases, and better tests to
  make sure it's doing what I think it's doing.

1.3.5 and prior
===============

Go to github, look at the incredibly long and painful old version of CHANGELOG.  Weep.  Hate
Nerdmaster for being such a moron.
