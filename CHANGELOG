Version 1.5
===========

API changes:
------------

Deprecating prepend_handler in favor of before_filter, set_callback, and after_filter.
prepend_handler and current event system stay in for a while, but won't last forever....

Related to above: callback and filters must very explicitly break the chain, and it should
only be done in very specific situations.

Callbacks should be looked at as the core code, the response to an action.  They
should be used to actually handle an event: a bot's "PRIVMSG #channel Hey there, bob" output on
a "bob joins the channel" message.  Filters are more for behind-the-scenes stuff: responding to a
PING, storing stats, logging, manipulating input/output, changing variables (bot's nickname on an
:incoming_nick event), etc.

A plugin could use a filter where one isn't really appropriate, and this may make sense for a
plugin built for a very specific purpose - but the *final* program should be the only thing that
registers the callback, because there can be only one.  When you call set_callback, any previous
callback is lost, PERIOD.

Looking at this like Rails, the callback would be the action, while filters would be... filters.
Looking at it like wordpress, the callback is the core WP code, while the filters are your plugin
actions.  One plugin author shouldn't be breaking another's ability to work.  Again, exceptions to
every rule: for instance, an "ignore user" plugin could stop an event from ever reaching the
callback.

1.5 issues
----------

Though I got it working fairly well, the legacy support isn't 100% compatible with 1.4.3:
* Reporting is now a separate module you have to include manually (or subclass IRCBot)
* Outgoing events have been modified heavily.  They are now callbacks instead of "core"
  functionality, and may run differently than expected.  For instance, you used to be unable to
  override the core output of a PRIVMSG; now you can.  You used to not be able to "break the chain"
  before an outgoing PRIVMSG command; now you can.  To keep legacy funcationality similar to how it
  worked previously, legacy events using the prepend_handler system will *not* be able to override 
  or break the chain for outgoing events.  But this comes at the cost of things potentially being
  out of order from what you're used to if you're trying to mix legacy handlers and new filters.
  The reporting module is, of course, using the new filters, so they may act strangely.
  * The output API should be exactly the same as it used to be, so for a simple app, you may not
    notice the difference.
* Generally speaking, mixing legacy and new handlers will result in interesting behaviors.  Try to
  update your app to use the new system if you want the full capabilities of the new API.

How to prepare your code for 2.0:
---------------------------------

* Convert all handlers to callbacks or filters as described in the documentation (latest stable
  version's docs are always available at http://ruby-irc-yail.nerdbucket.com/)
* Use on_xxx, hearing_xxx, heard_xxx, saying_xxx, and said_xxx if they simplify your code
* Handlers need only take a single parameter now, the event object itself
* Use the documentation to determine event methods available for a given event.  In a pinch, you can use this to help see what's available:
      $stderr.puts "Events of type #{event.type} have the following methods: #{event.public_methods(false).inspect}"
* Remove all direct calls to handle().  For custom events, use a call to dispatch() with a Net::YAIL::CustomEvent.new(:type => :blah, ...)
* When you need to break the event handling chain, call "event.handled!".  This name is meant to
  alert you that it has side effects and you usually shouldn't need to call it now that reporting
  is no longer forced on you so painfully.
  * Note that return values from event handlers no longer hold ANY meaning

Anything not well-documented, confusing, or done wrong?  Yell at me on github and maybe I'll fix it.

1.4.6
=====

The from data is always present on all events, even if it has to be blank, in order to accommodate
the edge cases where having data is expected, but it isn't there:
    NOTICE :ERROR from foo.bar.com

1.4.5
=====

Pulled fix for RFC 1459 compliance - newline should be CR-LF.

1.4.4
=====

SSL support has been enhanced by code I don't fully understand, but which a helpful user suggested
could fix the one-message-behind situation!

1.4.3
=====

New
---

* Support for SSL!  This is highly experimental as I know nothing of SSL.  I'm literally trying to
  steal the code from Ruby-IRC that does SSL and make it work with YAIL.  So far it doesn't seem to
  be working quite right - it's always one message behind for some reason.  This means on a channel
  with activity, it'll respond to events one message late.  On a channel without much activity, it
  can in fact miss pings and eventually is kicked off.  Help me!

1.4.2
=====

New
---

* YAIL now defaults to use Logger for all non-event logging.  Prepare for all logging to be pulled
  out of YAIL soon, but anything that stays core will be *real* logs (debug logs for IRC messages,
  fatal for truly critical errors, etc) instead of just STDERR prints.  You can access the log via
  yail_object.log in order to change loglevel and such, and pass in your own logger via YAIL's
  constructor.

Changes
-------

* Specifying :loud and :silent in the constructor are NOW DEPRECATED.  These will be removed by
  version 2, and possibly at the next minor version bump.  I hate them.  Instead, either specify
  your own logger via the :log key in the constructor, or change your object via something like
  `irc.log.level = ...`
  * @loud and @silent have been renamed to discourage using those directly as a way to avoid the
    deprecation warnings.  I will change these again, so don't rely on them!
    * Note that if you really hate the warnings, you can of course choose not to hear them -
      they're logged as WARN level events.
  * The default level will be WARN.  The "loud" level is DEBUG.  The "silent" level is FATAL.
  * Note that YAIL still uses @silent for suppressing event reports in the output API.  This is
    because I'm a moron, and I need to keep that functionality as-is until I tear it out of the
    library completely.  Some people who are really stupid (me) actually rely on that reporting.
    When I tear this stuff out is when deprecation ends and full removal of those options happens.
* Basic bot class is now in the file net/yail/irc_bot instead of net/yail/IRCBot, to better follow
  Ruby conventions.  I've left IRCBot there for now, but I may eventually take that away, so
  consider fixing your `requires` statements today!


1.4.1
=====

Had some screwups here before deploying the gem, so this version was removed

1.4.0
=====

New
---

* HOLY CRAP!  I never provided a topic change event?!?  Well, now it's here.  :incoming_topic_change
  at your service.  Note that this is VERY DIFFERENT from the numeric :incoming_topic event, which
  only tells you current topic for a channel.
  * NOTE: if you've been handling topic changes via the miscellaneous handler, you *will* have to
    change your code!
* prepend_handler can now take a block instead of just a Proc object!
* In addition to using the `start_listening` method of Net::YAIL, you can now call the "dangerous"
  version of that method: `start_listening!`, which wraps the "safe" version, but also starts an
  endless loop.  For extremely simple bots, this is simplifies your codebase greatly.
* New bot example added to demonstrate a very simple case that's still pretty easy to extend and
  configure: examples/simple/dumbbot.rb

Changes
-------

* CTRL+C termination now results in a graceful termination which includes sending QUIT to the server
* Major event handling overhaul.  Legacy apps *should* work fine, but if not, please let me know
  by filing a ticket on github or something!
  * For those who care, the back-end is now using a new class for handling and storing events.
    This class is eventually going to be used for all handlers, rather than passing around a bunch
    of arguments that are often unused.
* README was removed in favor of two files: YAIL-RDOC for the rdoc "intro" info, and README.md for
  a github-friendly description of the bot.

Fixes
-----

* Nickname change in forced handler is now safer
* Version information is now stored outside the main YAIL library
* TODO updated a lot to better reflect my short-, medium-, and long-term goals
* General update to documentation - a few grammatical fixes, some doc errors fixed, etc
* MessageParser fixes to make it better at handling some of the edge cases, and better tests to
  make sure it's doing what I think it's doing.

1.3.5 and prior
===============

Go to github, look at the incredibly long and painful old version of CHANGELOG.  Weep.  Hate
Nerdmaster for being such a moron.
