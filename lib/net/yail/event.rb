  # common, so this class is primarily to facilitate the new system.

  # This is the incoming event class.  For all situations where the server
  # sent us some kind of event, this class handles all the data.
  #
  # All events will have a :raw attribute that stores the exact text sent from
  # the IRC server.  Other possible pieces of data are as follows:
  # * fullname: Rarely needed, full text of origin of an action
  # * nick: Nickname of originator of an event
  # * channel: Where applicable, the name of the channel in which the event
  #   happened.
  # * text: Actual message/emote/notice/etc
  # * target: User targeted for various commands - PRIVMSG/NOTICE recipient, KICK victim, etc
  # * pm?: Set to true if the event is a "private" event (not sent to the
  #   channel).  Useful primarily for message types of events (PRIVMSG).
  #
  # To more easily call the right user event, we store each event type and its "parent" where it
  # makes sense.  This ensures that a user currently handling :incoming_ctcp won't be totally
  # screwed when we add in :incoming_userinfo and such.  Top-level handlers aren't in here, which
  # is vital to avoid trying to hack around numerics (not to mention a bunch of fairly useless
  # data)
  #
  # Look at the source for specifics of which IRC events set up what data.  Or try to parse the
  # lovely RFCs....
  #
  # For convenience, the event stores its MessageParser object so users can access raw data as
  # necessary (for numeric messages, this is often useful)
