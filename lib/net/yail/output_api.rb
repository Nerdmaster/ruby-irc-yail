# This module is responsible for the raw socket output, buffering of all "message" types of
# events, and exposing the magic to create a new output command + handler.  All output methods
# are documented in the main Net::YAIL documentation.

  # speaking, that is.

  # Creates an output command and its handler.  output_base is a template of the command without
  # any conditional arguments (for simple commands this is the full template).  args is a list of
  # argument symbols to determine how the event is built and handled.  If an argument symbol is
  # followed by a string, that string is conditionally appended to the output in the handler if the
  # event has data for that argument.

  # ugly one-liner than manually, and things like define_method seem to fall short with how much
  # crap this needs to do.
