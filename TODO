==High priority

Stuff to do soon

* Get Event class working with all IRC messages
  * Maybe rename from IncomingEvent to IRCServerEvent and OutgoingEvent to IRCClientEvent since
    that actually describes protocol and originator.  Then add CustomEvent for things like
    :irc_loop.
    * Type also set to :incoming_ and :outgoing_ - change this, too?
* Get YAIL using Event class for parsing all data.  First step toward passing around the event as
  an object is to use it for parsing....
* Make non-event reporting more of a real log (use Ruby's Logger class, even).  Most current
  reporting would be of "INFO" level, with the "if @loud" type of options being "DEBUG".  This
  gives users of the library a whole lot more control.  Default will still be stdout, and logging
  will be set to ERROR on @silent option, INFO with no specific option, and DEBUG on @loud option.

==Version 2.0

When ready to change the API...

* Pass around events instead of various arguments for handlers
* Restructure events to have before- and after-event filters that happen around event handler, and
  (generally) don't mess with the event handler.
  * Event happens:
    * Find before filters for event, then event's parent, then parent's parent, etc.  If any filter
      handles the event, end here.  Filters should ALMOST NEVER do this, as it kills handlers!
    * Find handlers for event, parent, parent-parent.  Run until one handles the event.  Handlers
      should return true to indicate they've done their job, so handling :ctcp should mean your
      :privmsg handler isn't going to re-handle the event!
    * Find after filters for event, parent, parent-parent.  Run all.
  * prepend_handler deprecated, calls add_handler instead.
  * Provide add_before_filter, add_after_filter, add_handler - no need to prepend anything anymore
    since filtering will allow for reporting and such as necessary without handler clutter.
  * Rename "handle" method to "dispatch" - makes more sense with this model
* Reporting should be an optional plugin *at most*.  Not required, and not part of the normal event
  chain.  Post-event filters would be okay if they were all registered in an optional library the
  user has to explicitly opt for.

==Low priority

Someday....

* Fix events to give more useful output for :incoming_mode events - at the least, parse out the
  various targets as some kind of hash.  Very complex mode-parsing may be necessary.
  For the command ":User!foo@bar.com MODE #bots +bivk-mv Towelie!*@* Doogles foo Towelie"
  * User is banning Towelie!*@*
  * User is setting "+i" to #bots
  * User is giving Doogles +v
  * User is setting channel key to "foo"
  * User is setting "-m" on #bots
  * User is taking away Towelie's voice (-v)
* Eventually build an event object for outgoing event handlers.  This may not
  ever really be necessary, as outgoing events have very specific arguments
  and the handling of events isn't nearly as commonplace as handling incoming
  events.
* Allow multiple targets / hostmask / etc in outgoing PRIVMSG and NOTICE
* Allow incoming PRIVMSG to have multiple parts - :actor PRIVMSG victim :Hello there, sir!\001USERINFO\001
  * Allow IncomingEvent.parse to actually return multiple events?  Would help with modes, too.
  * Add special handlers for some of this stuff so it's not up to user to parse.
    :incoming_userinfo, :incoming_version, :outgoing_userinfo, etc.
* Allow for CTCP quoting/dequoting...?  Don't know much about this - read up!
* New API for handlers - keep old because it's still useful
  * said_xxx {|args| do_stuff} => same as prepend_handler(:outgoing_xxx)
  * heard_xxx {|args| do_stuff} => same as prepend_handler(:incoming_xxx)
* CTCP formatting:
  * Color is ^C<fore>[,<back>]
  * Bold is ^B to toggle on or off
  * See silverplatter - appears to have all formatting options I'd want.
    Yay theft!
  * Use *optional* output filtering to allow pipe-commands, such as
    "|2,3|BFoo|PBar" => bolded blue on green "Foo", followed by plain "Bar"
* CTCP commands (VERSION, PING, etc): http://www.invlogic.com/irc/ctcp.html
* Figure a nice way to do better throttling for output.  If there are enough
  channels or people bugging a bot, it could spam itself off the network right
  now due to the "send one message per second... to every damn thing that has
  something in its queue" rule.
